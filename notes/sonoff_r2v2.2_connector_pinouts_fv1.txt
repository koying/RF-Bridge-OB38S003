RX pin to GPIO3 (U0RXD)(pin 25)

** J3 connector to ESP8265
USBRXD to GPIO4 (pin 16)
USBTXD to GPIO5 (pin 24)


** J3 connector to J2 connector
RXD to TX (by way of R1 1 kohm)
TXD to RX (by way of R2 1 kohm)


** ESP8265
GPIO0 (pin 15) to push button
GPIO12 (pin 10) to pad on back of board
GPIO13 (pin 12) to R22 to LED2 (wifi led)
GPIO14 (pin 9) goes to pad on back of board (and pulled (up?) to power through R15
GPIO15 (pin 13) is pulled to ground through R18

Configuration can be set during flashing to make RESET pin function as reset.
Applying 3.3 V and then removing it causes reset to occur (is pin pulled low normally internally?; edge triggered?).
